A pony (e.g, "Tony the Pony" \cite{tony}) is a beautiful, with a dark 
colour, animal, that is found in many yards. Beside cats.

There are approximately 100000 ponies in the so-called ``USA'', of which 
45\% have a web presence on internet.

In more details, about 30\% of ponies spend approximately 8,145 hours a day on 
Facebook which can't be a good thing for for them..
